I used "trace" first to figure out sequence in which the statements in the app was executed. Once I reviewed the output from the log methods I found out that from the beginning of my HTML file , I had an incorrect closing tag for the heading tag. I had "<h1>Sample Magazines<h1>" when it was supposed to be "<h1>Sample Magazines</h1>". Also in the the HTML file, in the calculateTotal() function, there I had a syntax error in the "If" statement, it should be:
            if (quantity1 < 0 || quantity2 == 0 || quantity3 == 0) instead of what I had earlier (quantity1 < 0 || quantity2 < 0 || quantity3 < 0)-->

            <!--From my CSS file I had the margin property which was set to "Q" in some places for some reason and that was of course an invalid value so I changed that to . I accidently had a "@"" symbol a syntax error which was later removed  from "line margin: @ 1px;"" so I changed that to margin to the valid form: "margin: 1px;"" -->
