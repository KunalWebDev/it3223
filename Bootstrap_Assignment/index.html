        <h5 class="card-title">Baseball</h5>
          <p class="card-text">Like I said I played I played third base as well as all outfield positions. I even tried playing as an amateur pitcher because the coach said I had a long arm, even though, to say the least, I hit a lot of batters, which was "fun," but it was a good learning experience. I played for EWA, or East Williamson Athletics. I played ever since I was 6 and played on a variety of "rec" team names, when in reality we were always playing as travel teams. I played for the EWA "Braves," "Red," and "Orioles." I was so great at my age when I was on the Orioles team that I also played at the same time on what my coach called an "All Star team," where he chose the top three best players on the team to join the All Star team, which was called the "Strikers," to play in summer tournaments.</p>
