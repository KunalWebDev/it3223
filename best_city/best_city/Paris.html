          <p id="isPasted">
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">For all the talk of learning from the pandemic, one city appears to be going all-in on the hard lessons it gave and their application to molecular urban change.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">While the face of Paris’s pandemic evolution is Mayor Anne Hidalgo and her aggressive empowerment of self-propelled mobility—from a city-wide speed limit of 30 km/h introduced last year to the obsessive addition of bike paths, with the promise of 745 miles by 2026 across most arrondissements it’s the citizenry’s embrace of this boldness that is changing the city’s fabric for good.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">While the city has been wracked by unemployment and economic calamity since 2020 (Paris, while much improved from 2021, ranks #183 globally in our Employment subcategory this year), the walkable city ambition has aligned with the need for natural therapy and outdoor social distancing. Of course, being able to enjoy a city ranked best in the world in our Sights &amp; Landmarks subcategory, as well as in the top three for Museums (the city has well over 100), has a tendency to distract one from the modern world’s perils.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Almost as soon as the pandemic started, Parisians poured out of their close quarters onto the iconic Rue de Rivoli, the famed artery that intersects the heart of the capital, when it became off-limits to cars. Cars were also banned from the banks of the Seine and pretty much every other one of the world’s favorite spots where, surreally, flâneurs found themselves able to take a deep breath of air without a hint of exhaust while actually hearing birdsong in what many say felt like a walk back in time.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Especially the fact that there was nary a selfie stick or sudden-stopping tourist to run into.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">All of that has changed, of course, with France’s removal of health measures earlier this year and tourism rushing back into the de-motorized streets, injecting much-needed revenues and, in some cases, exceeding pre-pandemic levels, according to government estimates. Almost three years without Paris certainly drove the voraciousness, but so did the euro being on par with the U.S. dollar for most of 2022.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">According to French government estimates, tourists actually spent 10 percent more in France this summer than they did in 2019, which itself was one of the highest tourism-spending years on record. Not surprisingly, the single biggest beneficiary was the City of Light.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">What returning visitors find is a city that has codified pedestrianism and alfresco living.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">To ensure cars didn’t take back control of Paris streets as pandemic urban pilot projects waned—as was the case in many other cities—Mayor Hidalgo legislated that the 60,000 parking spots loaned to restaurants for outdoor seating simply remained. The same went for closing off lesser-driven streets entirely for public walking and seating for local businesses in need of additional outdoor space.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">Nowhere is the transformation more dramatic than along the River Seine in the heart of Paris’s tourist district, near Notre Dame Cathedral and city hall itself. With the reduced car traffic, this is now Paris’s town square (in a city with dozens of historic spots worthy of the honor). The riverside promenade hosted thousands night after night, even after Paris’s Right Bank summer event wrapped up. The Paris Plages urban beach initiative welcomes picnicking and other low-cost access to a city long criticized as pricey and exclusive.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">And speaking of Notre Dame, its reopening in 2024 aligns with what will be a vital year for the city, when it also hosts the 2024 Olympic Summer Games, with many events integrated right into the revered urban fabric. And nothing would go further to demonstrate the city’s efficacy in achieving a cleaner, healthier Paris than being able to host swimming events for athletes and the general public post-Games. After wild Atlantic salmon first returned to the Seine 13 years ago, it is today home to more than 30 species of fish, like trout, perch and eel. Considering Paris’s plan to hold the 2024 opening ceremonies not in a stadium but by floating down its sacred river, nursing it back to health would be incredibly poetic, even in a town that invented poetic gestures. Those Paris heatwaves would certainly become more tolerable.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The Champs-Élysées is next on the city leadership’s list, set to be transformed for the Games into a massive garden, with vehicle access cut in half and millions of euros invested in pedestrian-focused amenities.</span>
          </p>
          <p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem;">The torrent of new and renoed hotels in the city is also doubling down on outdoor spaces. The year-old Kimpton St Honoré is topped by a bucolic 3,200-square-foot terrace called Sequoia that serves up panoramic views of the iconic skyline. The Hôtel Rochechouart, which opened in late 2020 in the 9th arrondissement, also has a little-publicized 1,000-square-foot perch from which to admire Sacré-Cœur and the Eiffel Tower in air scented by the wild lavender and berry bushes planted all around. A bientôt mes amis.</span>

      <h2 class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-7"> PARIS HAS AN UNDERGROUND CITY&nbsp;</h2>
      <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-8"> Paris is undeniably a beautiful city but it also has darkness beneath its walls — a full city of darkness commonly known as the Paris underground city. This city is called “The Catacombs”.</p>
      <h2 class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-9">PARIS THE CITY OF LIGHT</h2>
      <div class="u-black u-preserve-proportions u-shape u-shape-circle u-shape-1"></div>
      <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-10"> Paris is called the city of light because it was one of the first European cities to install street lights.&nbsp;This was commissioned by Louis XIV in the 17th century to put more light on the streets as a way of restoring the city’s safety that had deteriorated due to the recently concluded wars.But up to now, the nickname is so popular making the city even more special. Now that’s one Paris fact that I am sure you didn’t know about.</p>
      <h2 class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-11"> THE "SIENE RIVER" TURNS PART OF PARIS INTO 2 ISLANDS</h2>
      <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-12"> There are 2 remaining natural islands in Paris and that is all thanks to the Seine river.With the islands of Île de la Cité&nbsp;which is the biggest and also famous for having the Notre Dame cathedral and L’île Saint-Louis (all of which are connected by bridges), Paris can proudly say that it also has islands.</p>
      <h2 class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-13">THE FIRST "BLOODY MARY" WAS MADE IN PARIS</h2>
      <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-14"> One of the fun facts about Paris is that the famous cocktail, Bloody Mary was first made in the French Capital.</p>
      <h2 class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-15"> THE TRADITION OF “LOVE ROCKS” DID NOT START IN PARIS</h2>
      <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-16"> However, it’s easy to see why most people might have thought that since Paris is usually associated with love locks compared to any other place in the world.So if not Paris, where did this tradition start from? The tradition of locking padlocks started in a small town of Serbia, as a result of a failed love affair between 2 young lovers (Nada and Relja).And since the relationship failed due to the infidelity of Relja which broke Nada’s heart, the young women in the town decided to start locking padlocks with their names and those of their lovers on the “bridge of love” and later throw the keys into the river as a sign of a life long commitment without infidelity.And later on, everyone in the town and Serbia started locking padlocks as a sign of love which then spread all across Europe.But Paris being the&nbsp;<a href="https://dreamsinparis.com/is-paris-the-city-of-love/" class="u-active-none u-border-none u-btn u-button-style u-hover-none u-none u-text-palette-1-base u-btn-2">city of love</a>, it became the forefront of locking padlocks on bridges that so many people mistaken it to be the origin of this romantic activity.
      </p>
      <h2 class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-17">PARIS DOES NOT HAVE ANY "STOP" SIGNS</h2>
      <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-18"> Now if you come from a country whose roads are marked with “STOP” on every turn you make, you’re in for one big surprise. It’s one of the facts about Paris, France that blows everyone’s mind who hears about it.Actually, even the 1 stop sign that ever existed at the exit of a construction company in the 16th arrondissement magically disappeared which makes Paris a “STOP” free city. But Parisians still make it work with other numerous road signs.</p>
      <h2 class="u-custom-font u-text u-text-19"> PARIS HAS 450 PARKS AND GARDENS</h2>
      <p class="u-custom-font u-font-roboto-slab u-small-text u-text u-text-variant u-text-20"> Paris is the heart of picnics and this could be thanks to the 450 parks and gardens spread across the city.
